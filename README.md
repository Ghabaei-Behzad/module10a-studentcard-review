# Module 10A – StudentCard Code Review

## Description
This is a React code review assignment. I reviewed the StudentCard component and added comments to explain the logic behind props, state, and interactivity. A ternary operator is used for a toggle function that uses a button. When the button is clicked the message on the button changes and the tile becomes smaller, or larger to include the bio.  Two files are used which are StudentCard.jsx and App.jsx Localhost was succesful.

## What I Learned
- How to use and identify props and state
- How toggle functionality works with useState
- How to better document and explain React components
- The elements were simple. Using <p> <div> <img> is really basic stuff. The syntax was a bit
- new and they could change the readability of the program. Errors could arise from the comments
- syntax. Also the import statement was needed and was critical for the visibiity of the student - card.   It was really difficult to push my files to github and I needed lots of help. I got
- help from github.com when a new repository is created.  The previous README.md was removed.

## Screenshot
